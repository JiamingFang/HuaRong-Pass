I ran the program using python 3.7.3 64-bit on windows
command to run program:
python .\Astar.py #NumOfPuzzle #NumOfAlgorithm

Num of puzzle can only be 1 or 2
1 reads puzzle1.txt
2 reads puzzle2.txt

Num of Algorithm can be 1/2/3
1 runs AStar algorithm
2 runs BFS
3 runs DFS

Example:
python .\Astar.py 1 2
runs puzzle1.txt using BFS

The input file must be in same folder, generated output will be in same folder as well

Both AStar and BFS will produce the optimal solution, DFS will not but it is much faster
